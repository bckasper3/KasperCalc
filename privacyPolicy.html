<h3>KasperCalc Privacy Policy</h3>
</br>
    <span>
    Effective Date: 12/09/2024 (December 9th, 2024)

    If there is a conflict between the Privacy Policy any other part of the website, the order of precedence is as follows: Disclaimer, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy.</br>
    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    Welcome to KasperCalc (the "Website"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect and how we use it.

    By using our Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

    <h4>2. Information We Collect</h4>
    At KasperCalc, we do not collect any personal information directly from you except for data that is automatically collected through third-party services, such as Google Analytics.

    Google Analytics: We use Google Analytics to track user activity on our Website. This service collects information such as your IP address, browser type, device type, location, time spent on the Website, pages visited, and other interaction data. This information helps us analyze how users engage with the Website and improve the user experience.
    <h4>3. How We Use Your Information</h4>
    The information we collect through Google Analytics is used for the following purposes:

    To understand how users interact with our Website and improve its content and functionality.
    To track trends and patterns in Website usage.
    To monitor and analyze the performance of the Website.
    We do not use this data to personally identify you.

    <h4>4. Cookies</h4>
    Google Analytics uses cookies to collect data about your browsing behavior. A cookie is a small file placed on your device that helps us gather the necessary data to analyze Website traffic.

    You can control the use of cookies on your device through your browser settings. However, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain features on the Website.

    Because the Google Analytics data is not shared with 3rd party advertising agencies or sold, this website is not required to have an "Accept Cookies" popup.

    <h4>5. Data Retention</h4>
    The data collected by Google Analytics is stored by Google for a period of time, as determined by their policies. For more information on Google’s data retention practices, you can refer to Google’s privacy policy: Google Privacy & Terms.

    <h4>6. Data Security</h4>
    We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. However, since we do not directly collect personal data, we rely on third-party services like Google Analytics to manage and secure the data they collect. Google uses secure data storage and encryption technologies to protect the data it collects.

    <h4>7. Your Rights and Choices</h4>
    Opt-out of Google Analytics: You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. This will prevent Google Analytics from tracking your data on all websites.
    Cookies Control: You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note that some features of the Website may not function properly if cookies are disabled.
    <h4>8. Sharing of Information
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. However, we may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with third parties for analytical purposes, such as understanding Website usage trends.

    <h4>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
